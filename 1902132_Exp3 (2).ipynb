Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n#### Defining a Function\nYou can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.\nFunction blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).<br>\nAny input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.<br>\nThe first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.<br>\nThe code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.<br>\nThe statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller.
